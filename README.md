# Console-Quest

Concolse Quest is a game I developed for my Freshman project during that year of college, designed to run inside of the Windows command prompt. Simply run the "play_game.py" file, and it should run just fine. Confirmation on whether or not it fully works on Mac computers is currently pending, however unless I am seriously mistaken, it should at the very least still run.
