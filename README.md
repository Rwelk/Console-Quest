# Console-Quest

Console Quest is a game I developed for my Freshman college project, designed to run inside of the command prompt. It is played by running the "play_game.py" file. Confirmation on whether or not it fully works on Mac computers is currently pending, however unless I am seriously mistaken, it should at the very least still run.

Thank you for spending the time to check it out!
